## Project Abstract
Vidol is a K-POP related web service that helps idol fans enjoy their favorite idols' contents much more diversely. and conveniently. There are two main problems idol fans encounter when following up K-POP contents: they are so scattered and it is extremely hard to exclude unwanted parts in video contents. Therefore,  Vidol provides two main features: serving integrated data and extracting user-wanted parts in videos.<br/><br/>Vidol collects and processes data of idols in advance by crawling. With the well-organized data we provide, users can follow up updates of their favorites easily. All users need to do is just typing the name of  idols. It is the same in video indexing service. When users input the video url and the idol they want to extract parts of, with machine learning, Vidol scans the video and index it either by scene change or appearing figures. With the result, users can recreate contents by saving and editing it.<br/><br/>Our goal is to boost K-POP fanship culture up by enabling effiecient content consumption and recreation. As K-POP market is growing and Vidol itself promotes creating contents, the importance and the utility of Vidol would get more significant over time.
